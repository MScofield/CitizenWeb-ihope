# CitizenWeb
This is the prototype for an awareness platform designed to help community organizers and busy families.
Families keep track of your local civic functions and key decision makers at the neighborhood and ward level.
Organizers see your attendance and stay connected to your base.
Everybody get up, show up, speak up.
